# Development Summary - Phase 5: User-Driven Click-Based Detection

## Overview

Phase 5 implements user-driven sub-image detection within scanned images. Users can now click directly on any sub-image within the preview to trigger intelligent boundary detection using an 8-directional traversal algorithm. Orange overlay rectangles show the detected regions based on user clicks.

## Key Deliverables Completed

### 1. Click-Based Detection System
- **Interactive Image Clicking**: Users click directly on sub-images to trigger detection
- **Coordinate Mapping**: Properly converts display coordinates to actual image coordinates accounting for scaling
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate detection and overlay rendering after each click

### 2. 8-Directional Boundary Detection Algorithm
- **Smart Traversal**: Algorithm traverses outward from click point in 8 directions:
  - Cardinal directions: Top, Bottom, Left, Right
  - Diagonal directions: Top-left, Top-right, Bottom-left, Bottom-right
- **Background Detection**: Configurable scanner background detection (white/black/auto)
- **Intelligent Sampling**: Uses 3x3 pixel sampling around each traversal step for robust boundary detection
- **Minimum Thresholds**: Respects configurable minimum area and dimension requirements

### 3. Enhanced User Interface
- **Crosshair Cursor**: Visual indicator that the image is clickable
- **Click Instructions**: Clear guidance on how to use the detection feature
- **Detection Counter**: Shows number of detections from number of clicks
- **Clear Functionality**: Button to reset all click-based detections
- **Orange Overlays**: Consistent color coding for all user-generated detections

### 4. IPC Communication
- Added `image:analyze-click` IPC channel for click-based analysis
- Coordinate validation and error handling
- Performance tracking (detection time in milliseconds)

## Technical Implementation

### Detection Algorithm Flow
```
1. User clicks on image → 2. Convert display coords to image coords
→ 3. Load image and convert to grayscale → 4. Traverse 8 directions from click point
→ 5. Sample pixels for background detection → 6. Find boundary points in each direction
→ 7. Calculate minimum bounding box → 8. Validate against thresholds
→ 9. Return bounding box with high confidence
```

### Key Files Added/Modified
- `src/shared/types.ts` - Added click-based analysis types and IPC channels
- `src/main/services/ImageAnalysisService.ts` - Implemented 8-directional detection algorithm
- `src/main/ipc-handlers.ts` - Added click-based analysis IPC handler
- `src/renderer/components/ImagePreview/BasicDetectionOverlay.tsx` - Orange overlay rendering
- `src/renderer/components/ImagePreview/ImageDisplayWithAnalysis.tsx` - Click handling and UI
- `src/main/preload.ts` - Added click analysis IPC channel

### Dependencies Used
- `image-js` - Image processing and pixel analysis
- `uuid` - Unique ID generation for detected sub-images

## Usage

1. Select an image from the file explorer
2. Click directly on any sub-image within the preview
3. Orange rectangle appears showing the detected boundary
4. Click on additional sub-images to detect more regions
5. Use "Clear Detections" button to reset all detections
6. Bottom info panel shows detection count and click count

## Algorithm Features

### Background Detection
- **Configurable Background**: Supports white, black, or auto-detection
- **Tolerance-Based Matching**: 30-pixel tolerance for color variations
- **Sample-Based Analysis**: 70% threshold for background pixel classification

### Boundary Traversal
- **Incremental Steps**: 2-pixel step size for efficient traversal
- **Edge Fallback**: Uses image edges when no background boundary found
- **Robust Sampling**: 3x3 pixel regions for reliable boundary detection

### Validation & Quality
- **Minimum Area**: Configurable minimum area threshold (default: 2500 pixels)
- **Minimum Dimensions**: Configurable minimum width/height (default: 30 pixels)
- **High Confidence**: User-driven detections assigned 1.0 confidence score

## Performance Characteristics

- Detection typically completes in 50-200ms per click
- Memory efficient - single grayscale conversion per analysis
- Scales well with image size due to targeted traversal approach
- Debug mode available for development with image saving

## User Experience Benefits

- **Full User Control**: Users decide exactly which sub-images to detect
- **Immediate Feedback**: Instant visual confirmation of detection results
- **Flexible Workflow**: Can detect any number of sub-images in any order
- **Error Recovery**: Easy to clear and retry detections
- **Visual Clarity**: Consistent orange overlay color for all detections

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
- Adjustable detection sensitivity settings in UI
- Multiple background color detection in single image
- Batch processing of multiple click points
- Export functionality for detected sub-image regions
